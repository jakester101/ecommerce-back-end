# E-Commerce Back End

  ## Description 
  
  The objective of this project is to simulate the server side of an e-commerce application that sells goods. This is done by managing a database pull of products and product categories and id's, and having the functionality to edit said database with the use of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests.

  ## Installation
  
  Install the database using mySQL and then seed it using "node seeds/index.js". The .env file will need to bed edited to your own credentials. Install npm packages and launch the server using nodemon or node server start.
  
  ## Usage 
  
  We can examine the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE functionality on the localhost using an application called Insomnia.
